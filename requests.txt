Some of the tests I think would be helpful:

Test memory (might be able to re-assemble stress12 for this

Test that each task works (load up both tasks with similar memory maps and check to see that the map changes when the task changes

Test that CRM works across two tasks

Test that CRM memory is really the next to highest page in the $3f bank

Test reading MMU registers back (6 bits read, 8 bits read)

Test that $ff9d/9e GFX memory offset works correctly (right now, not sure if VDG emulation in CC3 uses this offset or not), but whatever it does, the CC2+CoCoMEMJr needs to do the same

If you set VDG to 127*512 as the base offset, and set up a 6kB hi res screen, does VDG memory accesses above $ffff wrap to $0000 or $010000?


The actual memory test (#1) is actually the least of my concerns.  It's the other stuff I need to test.
